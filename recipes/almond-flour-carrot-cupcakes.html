    <img src="https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Moist-Gluten-Free-Carrot-Cake.jpg" alt="almond flour carrot cake muffins">

    <p> I know what you're thinking... That is indeed a cake, not cupcakes. The truth is, it's not easy to find tasty almond flour dessert recipes in cupcake form, so I just chose an almond flour recipe and baked them in cupcake trays. </p> 

    <span> </span>

    <p> I have baked these cupcakes several times now and my family can't even tell that they are made with almond flour. This cupcake recipe has all the healthier qualities you can ask for in a dessert, while still tasting delicious. </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            3/4 cups packed dark brown sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            1/3 cup pure maple syrup
        </li>
        <li>
            2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cups shredded carrots (about 4 medium or 10 ounces)
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup canola oil
        </li>
        <li>
            3/4 cup raisins
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ol> <strong> Instructions </strong>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two, 8-inch round cake pans with parchment paper, then coat with nonstick spray. Lightly dust with almond flour, tapping out excess.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread the nuts in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Place in the oven and bake until toasted and fragrant, about 8 minutes. Remove to a cutting board. Let cool slightly. Measure out ¾ cup, then finely chop for the batter. Reserve the rest for decorating the cake.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves, and remaining 3 cups almond flour.
        </li>
        <li>

            In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a large mixing bowl, beat eggs and brown sugar on medium high until pale toasty brown, fluffy, and nearly tripled in volume, about 5 to 7 minutes. (Don’t shortcut this step—it helps make the batter airy). Beat in the maple syrup and vanilla.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pat the carrots dry. Place in a clean medium mixing bowl. Stir in the oil, coconut, raisins, and chopped nuts.
        </li>
        <li>
            With the mixer running on low speed, add one-third of the almond flour mixture to the egg mixture. Once it disappears, add half of the carrot mixture. Add the next one-third of the flour mixture, then remaining carrot mixture, then the last one-third of the flour, fully incorporating after each addition.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill batter into cupcake trays and smooth the tops. Bake cupcakes until they are lightly browned on top, a toothpick inserted into the center of the layers comes out clean, and the tops spring back lightly when touched about 20 to 25 minutes in. The cupcakes will be a deep golden brown. Place the pans on a wire rack and let cool in the pans 10 minutes. Carefully run a dull knife around edges to release the cakes, then invert them onto the rack to cool completely.
